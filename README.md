**Heart Disease Prediction**
----------------------------------------------------------
**Introduction**:-

This research was developed in order to understand how various physical features affect the occurrence of a heart
disease. The detailed analysis investigates what features interact the most with heart disease predictive
attribute and how each feature relates to the target variable.  Machine Learning techniques *Logistic Regression Classification*, *Random
Forest*, *Neural Networks*, *SVM* were tested and their performances were analyzed. Various validation
techniques and elimination of a certain set of variables to improve models by different feature selection
techniques were explored.

**Software Requirement**:-

Python  - Python 3.8.0 

Pandas -  1.1.4

Scikit - 0.23.2
